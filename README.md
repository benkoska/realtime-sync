## Installation
```bash
npm install realtime-sync
```

## Features
- Real-time sync
- Offline support
- Conflict resolution

## Usage
```typescript
// Declare your models
import { ClientModel, Collection, Computed, Model, OneToMany, Property } from "realtime-sync";

@ClientModel({ name: "Organization" })
export default class Organization extends Model {
    @Property()
    public id: string;

    @Property()
    public name: string;

    @OneToMany(() => User)
    public readonly members = new Collection<User>()

    @OneToMany(() => Team)
    public readonly teams = new Collection<Team>()

    @Computed()
    get items(): Issue[] {
        return this.teams.flatMap((team) => team.issues.items)
    }
}

// Declare the root node and create a state graph
import { StateGraph, createStateGraph } from 'realtime-sync';

const organization = { id: "1", name: 'Acme Inc.' } // root node

const graph: StateGraph<Organization> = createStateGraph(
    [Organization, Team, User, Issue], // models
    { type: 'Organization', ...organization }, // root node
    true // should auto-perform transactions
)

// Add new node to the graph (gotten from the server/web-socket)
graph.add({ type: 'User', ...userData })

// Get nodes from the graph
const user: User = graph.get<User>(User, '1')!
const users: Map<string, User> = graph.getAll<User>(User)!
const users: User[] = graph.getAllArray<User>(User)!
```

```typescript
// You can now use the data directly in your components using MobX (e.g. React)
import { observer } from 'mobx-react-lite';

// This component will re-render automatically when the user's name changes
const UserComponent = observer(({ user: User }) => {
    return <div>{user.name}</div>
})
```
